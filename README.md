# sample-php-crud
A small CRUD demo in PHP with minimal frontend done as a result of a small challenge to get to know the language.
Plugging the Demo folder in XAMPP and changing the MySQL login in the appropriate files should be enough as long as import the database.
The database was generated semi-randomly using tools online and all identities are purely fictional.
